<h2>Historicity</h2>
<p>Scholars are split as to the origin and meaning of the King Arthur stories. Some are of the opinion that he is a mytholigized historical King, taking on
    the accoutrements and fixings of a deity/hero of myth after his death. Others believe he nevver walked the earth physically at all, insted being the tattered remnants of a 
    previously existing indigenous brythonic deity. This remains a highly debated topic of scholarship.
