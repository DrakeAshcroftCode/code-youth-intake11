        <b>Run Wireless DJ, press “?” and follow the instructions. You will need to get your iPad on the same network with your Mac, then use Audio MIDI Setup to connect.

            Wireless DJ tries to reconnect when you launch it, but in some situations this may not work. Just run Audio MIDI Setup to reconnect to your existing session. Also, it may help to go to the MIDI Network Setup window and select “Anyone” from “Who can connect to me” box.
            
            If your get an IPv6 error when trying to connect, disabling IPv6 may help. Run this command in Terminal: networksetup -setv6off Ethernet</b>
    </p>

    <h3><b>Windows</b></h3>
    <p><b>Use third-party software, like rtpMIDI, to establish connection.</b></p>
